          The opened (<i>viewing</i>) pages of the flip book are always kept at
          the same elevation. This is necessary if your book has no inclination
          (is top-down-view). Have you noticed that you can also click on the
          pages edge? CSS will nicely animate the group of pages to skip with a
          staggered animation.

          Additionally JavaScript allows you to click on an anchor link in your
          text â€” without turning the page. You can also have multiple
          independent flip books in a single document. You're all covered.
